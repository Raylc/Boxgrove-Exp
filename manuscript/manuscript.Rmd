# Introduction

Handaxe is a well-studied and well-published topic, but some aspects of it still remain elusive. More specifically, the sources of variation of handaxe morphology can be very complex, but skill level and mental template are two major factors.

Skill level: short literature review

Mental template: short literature review

Here we have two interconnected research questions based on a reference sample generated from our 90-hour handaxe skill acquisition experiment: 1) Can skill level and mental template (or "aesthetic preference") be effeciently detected from biface morphometric data? 2) What is the effect of training on these two aspects?

# Materials and methods

## Boxgrove biface collection

The archaeological site of Boxgrove is located in the former Eartham quarry, Boxgrove, West Sussex, featuring a long sequence of Middle Pleistocene deposit [@roberts1998; @pope2020]. This 500-ka-old site has documented exceedingly rich details of Lower Paleolithic hominins' subsistence behaviors [@smith2012; @smith2013] and their paleoenvironmental contexts [@holmes2010]. In addition to the presence of one of the earliest hominin fossil [*Homo heidelbergensis*, @hillson2010] and bone assemblages with anthropogenic modifications in northern Europe [@bello2009], Boxgrove is mostly known for its large sample size of Late Acheulean-style flint handaxes and the high knapping skill level reflected in this manufacture of these handaxes. As such, it has received wide research attention in the past two decades regarding the relationships between technology, cognition, and skills [@stout2014; @iovita2011; @iovita2017; @shipton2015; @garcía-medrano2019]. To identify the morphological manifestation of knappers' dexterity in our study, we selected a complete handaxe assemblage (n=326) previously analyzed and reported in digital formats by Iovita and McPherron [@iovita2011], which is currently curated at the Franks House of the British Museum [@iovita2017].

## Experimental biface collection

The biface experimental replicas used in this study comprised two sub-collection. The first sub-collection includes 10 bifaces knapped by three expert knappers, including Bruce Bradley (n=4), John Lord (n=3), and Dietrich Stout (n=3) [@stout2014]. The second sub-collection is produced from a 90-hour handaxe knapping skill acquisition experiment [@bayani2021; @pargeter2019; @pargeter2020], where 30 adults with no previous experience in knapping were recruited from Emory University and its surrounding communities and requested to make 132 bifaces in total. Among these 30 adult participants, 17 have gone through multiple one-to-one or group training sessions that amounted to 89 hours in maximum, while the remaining 13 were assigned to the controlled group, where no formal training is given. As part of the preparation efforts, the experimental team spalled the Norfolk flints acquired through Neolithics.com into flat blanks of similar size and shape for training and assessments.

In this experiment, all research participants participated in the initial assessment (assessment 1 in our data set) before formal training, where they each produced a handaxe after watching three 15-minute videos of Late Acheulean style handaxes demonstrated by expert knappers and examining four Late Acheulean style handaxe replicas. Subsequently, the 17 participants in the experimental group were assessed after every ten hours of the cumulative learning period, where each of them was requested to produce a handaxe for expert knapper's review, leading to the compilation of a data set composing 9 assessements in total. It should be also noted that 6 out of 17 participants dropped out of the research before the final assessment due to personal reasons. To detect the effect of training on skill level and mental template, we reorganized our assessment classification scheme and combined it into three broader categories, namely pre-training (assessment 1), early training (assessment 2-5), and late training (assessment 6-9), which helps increase the sample size of the measured intervals. A more detailed experimental protocol can be assessed in one of our published papers [@pargeter2019].

## Lithic analysis

To better understand the morphological variation of Boxgrove biface collection, we adopted a standardized analytical procedure to extract the morphometric information from 752 photos of the studied samples prepared by R. I. [@iovita2011], which include both the front and lateral views of a given specimen. First, we used Adobe Photoshop to conduct a batch transformation of the samples' pixel scale into a real-world measurement scale based on the fixed photographic setting. This is then followed by the batch conversion of color photographs to a black-and-white binary format. Subsequently, we cropped the silhouettes of bifaces one by one using the Quick Selection Tool in Adobe Photoshop. The metric measurements were conducted in ImageJ [@rueden2017], where we employed a custom script [@pargeter2019] to measure the maximum length, width, and thickness of a given silhouette. The width and thickness measurements are taken at 10% increments of length starting at the tip of each biface (**Figure** \@ref(fig:ImageJ)), which eventually leads to 19 morphometric variables in total (1 length measurement, 9 width measurements, and 9 thickness measurements). Finally, we calculated the geometric means of all 19 linear measurements to create a scale-free data set that preserves the individual morphological variation at the same time [@lycett2006]. The same procedure was also applied to the morphometric analyses of the experimental biface collection, which was partially published in Pargeter et al. [-@pargeter2019].

```

## Statistical analyses

Given the number of variables involved in this study, we used the principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension and identify the possible patterns in this morphometric data set, which is one of the most commonly used techniques in similar studies [@iovita2011; @shipton2015; @stout2014; @garcía-medrano2020a; @garcía-medrano2020b]. To detect the effect of training on novices' performance as compared with archaeological samples and biface made by experts, we also compare the corresponding metrics built on PCA across different training periods and across all groups using the Games-Howell nonparametric post-hoc test, which does not rely on the assumptions of equal sample sizes and equal variance. This study adheres to the principles of reproducibility and data transparency of archaeological research by depositing all the codes and data sets involved in an open-access online repository [@marwick2017], which can be accessed through the author's Github (<https://github.com/Raylc/PaST-pilot>).

# Results

## Principal component analysis

Our analysis suggested that the first two components already explain 77.2% of the variation for the entire morphometric data set composed of 19 variables (**Figure** \@ref(fig:Screeplot)), which is a rather decent explained variance ratio to avoid overfitting. We then decided to focus on and further interpreted the implications of these first two components based on their relationships between variables (**Table** \@ref(tab:tab1)). The first principal component (PC1) indicates the overall biface thickness as it is positively correlated with all thickness measurements while negatively correlated with all other measurements. That being said, a higher PC1 value indicates a thicker biface, and vice versa. The second principal component (PC2) tracks the elongation and pointedness based on its positive relationship with maximum length and bottom width/thickness. As PC2 increases, a biface will be generally longer and more pointed since its bottom part will be bulkier.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figure/Scree plot.png"))
```

```{r tab1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df1<-read.csv(here::here("data/variable_loadings_pc12.csv"), fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM')
kableExtra::kbl(df1, booktabs = T, caption = "Variable loadings for the first two principal components") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "left", full_width = TRUE, latex_options = c("striped", "HOLD_position"), font_size = 8)%>%
kableExtra::row_spec(0, bold = T)

```

A closer look at the principal component scatter plot (**Figure** \@ref(fig:GeneralPCA1)) yields the clustering of different groups of bifaces. The majority of Boxgrove bifaces occupy an area featuring negative values of both PC1 and PC2. The expert group is similar to the Boxgrove group in PC1, while the former has a relatively higher PC2 value than the latter on average. The group of novice displays the highest level of variability, however, it is rather pronounced that most bifaces made by novices have a positive PC1 value that is different from both the groups of Boxgrove and experts.

```{r GeneralPCA1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap="A principal component scatter plot of bifaces from the groups of Boxgrove (red, n=326), expert (green, n=10), and novice (blue, n=132)."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figure/General PCA1.png"))
```

## Effects of training

We extracted the PC1 and PC2 values of individual bifaces and compared them between different groups. More specifically, the novice group was divided into three sub-groups based on their training stages as specified in the method section. As such, we found that for PC1 values (**Figure** \@ref(fig:PCA1)), the only two group comparisons that are **not** statistically significant are the one between Boxgrove and Expert and the one between Early training and Late training stages, which at least partially confirms our visual observation of the general PCA scatter plot. Likewise, for PC2 values (**Figure** \@ref(fig:PCA2)), the group comparison between the Early training and Late stages again is **not** statistically significant. However, a rather surprising result here is that the mean PC2 value difference between the Pre-training group and Boxgrove is also **not** statistically significant.

# Discussion

PC1 (thickness) is a robust indicator of skill level as it is shared by modern expert knapper and boxgrove foragers, while PC2 (elongation and pointedness) reflects more of personal/community-level aesthetic choices. However, we do not intend to construct a false binary framework and put these two factors as disconnected and opposite concepts.

In terms of our second research question, this study shows that training do have an immediate intervention effects (pre-training vs. post-training) in both PC1 (skill level) and PC2 (mental template). Nontheless, once the training has been initiated, its effects across different assessments on both dimensions are rather unconsipicous. This finding corroborates what has been suggested in Pargeter et al. [-@pargeter2019] that 90 hours of training for handaxe making is still not enough for novices to reach the skill level as reflected in expert knappers, considering the massive social support involved in the experiment set up including the direct and deliberate peadagogy and the simplified raw material procurement and preparation procedures. This follow-up project further adds the samples produced by Late Acheulean toolmaker as a new benchmark to deepen our understanding on this issue. It is noteworthy that how constrained is the Boxgrove assemblage morphological variation as measured by both PC1 and PC2 even when compared with the modern expert group (**Figure** \@ref(fig:GeneralPCA1)), especially given the fact that it has the largest sample size among all studied group. Some potential explainations for this phenomenon include 1) the strong idiosyncrasy of individual expert knappers shaped by their own unique learning and practice experience; and/or 2) the present day skill shortage of our expert knapper as compared with Boxgrove knappers despite their multiple years of knapping practice [@milks2019].

The pre-training group is similar to the Boxgrove group in PC2 because these novices lack the ability to effectively reduce the nodules, which are typically flat pre-prepared cortical flakes, to a desired form (**Figure** \@ref(fig:comparison)). That being said, if the given nodules already possess a oval morphology like those presented in the Boxgrove assemblage, it is likely the form of end products knapped by novices in the pre-training group will remain roughly unchanged. This explanation is also supported by the comparison of average delta weight, defined as the difference between the weight of handaxe and the weight of nodule, among four groups, where the pre-training group display the lowest value (**Figure** \@ref(fig:deltaweight)). On the other hand, the refitting analyses of the Boxgrove handaxe assemblage have suggested that the nodules exploited by foragers inhabiting this site are somewhat bulky and amorphous [@roberts1998: 339, 360]. These characteristics have been clearly displayed in a recent attempt of slow motion refitting of a handaxe specimen from Boxgrove GTP17 (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS58MUJ1ZEo>). As such, behind the resemblance of the pre-training group and the Boxgrove assemblage in PC2 are two types of mechanisms that are fundamentally different from each other, where the latter group exhibits a complex suite of cognitive and motor execution processes to transform the shapeless raw materials to a delicate end product in a given shape.

Experimental archaeology has a huge potential in similar topics.

Another contribution that we would like to highlight here is that this research project demonstrates the potential of reusing old archaeological data in digital format to address novel research questions. In this paper, the main source of archaeological data is a collection of photos produced and curated by one of our co-authors (R. Iovita) more than 10 years ago, and the morphological variation data of the experimental collection are also derived from photographs instead of remeasurements of the original replicas. Given the irreversible nature of archaeological excavation, the digitized data, be it text, pictures, or videos, often become the sole evidence that are available for certain research questions. Yet, it has been widely acknowledged that the reuse of archaeological data has not received enough attention among researchers in our discipline [@faniel2018; @huggett2018; @moody2021]. Among many reasons of preventing archaeologists from reusing published and digitized data [@sobotkova2018], the lack of a standardized practice of and motivation for data sharing is a prominent one [@marwick2018]. As stated in the method section, we addressed this issue through sharing the raw data and the code for generating the derived data on an open-access repository. Another major and legitimate concern of archaeological data resue is their quality. In terms of this aspect, we do acknowledge the limitations of relying on photos when it comes to more detailed technological analysis of stone artifacts, however, our paper shows that finding the approriate research questions given the data available is key to revealing new novel insights into the studied topic. Moreover, we believe that this type of research has a strong contempoarary relevance due to the continued influence of the COVID-19 on fieldwork-related travel and direct access to archaeological artifacts [@balandier2022; @ogundiran2021].

# Conclusions

Regarding the two research questions we proposed in the beginning, our case study suggested that 1) we can delineate the effects of skill level and mental template through the multivariate analysis of morphometric data, where the former is associated with thickness while the latter is reflected in elongation and pointedness; 2) Training has an effect, but 90 hours of training is still not enough for novice to reach the level of expertise.
